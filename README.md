## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Extra (added by me):

- View the optimal size for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Switch between light and dark themes
- Control the theme switch with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
